# Sorting Algorithms

<b>Bubble Sort</b>

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

<b>Selection Sort</b>

Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

<b>Insertion Sort</b>

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a final sorted array by repeatedly taking elements from the input array and inserting them into the correct position in the sorted array.

<b>Merge Sort</b>

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts the two halves, and then merges them into a single sorted array.

<b>Quick Sort</b>

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays such that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
